# Open Report Parser

A Perl based tool to parse DMARC reports, based on John Levine's [rddmarc](http://www.taugh.com/rddmarc/), but extended by the following features:
- Allow to read messages from an IMAP server and not only from the local filesystem.
- Store much more XML values into the database (for example the missing SPF and DKIM results from the policy_evaluated section) and also the entire XML for later reference.
- Needed database tables and columns are created automatically, user only needs to provide a database. The database schema is compatible to the one used by rddmarc, but extends it by additional fields. Users can switch from rddmarc to dmarcts-report-parser without having to do any changes to the database by themselves.
- Support for MySQL and PostgreSQL

Open Report Parser is a fork of [techsneeze's dmarcts-report-parser](https://github.com/techsneeze/dmarcts-report-parser), and was forked to more closely match the needs of [Open DMARC Analyzer](https://github.com/userjack6880/Open-DMARC-Analyzer).

Open Report Parser Version 0 Alpha 5 (0-α5) is an [Anomaly \<Codebase\>](https://systemanomaly.com/codebase) project by John Bradley (john@systemanomaly.com).

# Setting up Open Report Parser

Optaining Open Report Parser through `git` is probably the easiest way, in addition to doing occasional pulls to get up-to-date versions.

```
git clone https://github.com/userjack6880/Open-Report-Parser.git
```

Optionally, a [zip file of the latest release](https://github.com/userjack6880/Open-Report-Parser/releases) can be downloaded.

Rename `repoart-parser.conf.pub` to `report-parser.conf` and edit the configuration for your environment (see the next section on **Configuration Options** for details). Finally, some condierations need to be taken in account due to limitations in stock configurations of MySQL/MariaSQL on some distros, it may be necessary to add the following to your configuration (i.e. in /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf):

```
innodb_large_prefix	= on
innodb_file_format	= barracuda
innodb_file_per_table	= true
```

# Configuration Options

**Script Options**

```perl
$debug = 0;
$delete_reports = 0;
#$dmarc_only = 0;                           
# if set to 1, do not process tls reports, if set to -1 do not process
# dmarc reports - defaults to 1 for legacy support
# this is ignored for all methods except IMAP, use --tls to process
# TLS reports for other methods
```

**Database Options**

```perl
#$dbtype = 'mysql'; # Supported types - mysql, postgres - defaults to mysql if unset
$dbname = 'dmarc';
$dbuser = 'dmarc';
$dbpass = 'password';
#$dbhost = 'dbhost'; # Set the hostname if we can't connect to the local socket.
$dbport = '3306';
```

**IMAP Options**

```perl
$imapserver       = 'imap.server';
$imapuser         = 'username';
$imappass         = 'password';
$imapport         = '143';
$imapssl          = '0'; # If set to 1, remember to change server port to 993 and disable imaptls.
$imaptls          = '0';
$tlsverify        = '0';
$imapignoreerror  = '0'; # recommended if you use MS Exchange 2007, ...
#$imapauth        = 'simple'; # supported - simple, oauth2 - defaults to simple if unset

# see documentation for detailed setup
#$oauthclientid   = ''; 
#$oauthuri        = '';

$imapdmarcfolder  = 'dmarc';
$imaptlsfolder    = 'tls';

# If $imapxxxproc is set, processed IMAP messages will be moved (overruled by
# the --delete option!)
# $imapdmarcproc = 'dmarc.Processed';
# $imaptlsproc   = 'tls.Processed';

# If $imapxxxerr is set, IMAP messages that fail will be moved. If unset, failed messages
# will move to $imapdmarcproc (if it is set). Overruled by the --delete option!
# $imapdmarcerr = 'dmarc.notProcessed';
# $imaptlserr   = 'tls.notProcessed';
```

These settings are ignored when using the -m flag. When using SSL, TLS needs to be disabled and the port used should be changed to 993. TLS Verify is ignored.

Setting `$imapauth` to 'oauth2' enables OAuth2 authentication, and requires an initial dance to verify the application with your provider. Once this is done, it should be able to renew the token automatically on subsequent runs. Currently, only OAuth2 with M365 has been tested.

**XML Storage Options**

```perl
# maximum size of XML/JSON files to store in database, long files can cause transaction aborts
$maxsize_xml = 50000;
$maxsize_json = 50000;

# store XML/JSON as base64 encopded gzip in database (save space, harder usable)
$compress_xml = 0;
$compress_json = 0;
```

**Processing Failure Action**

```perl
# if there was an error during file processing (message does not contain XML or ZIP parts, 
# or a database error) the parser reports an error and does not delete the file, even if 
# delete_reports is set (or --delete is given). Deletion can be enforced by delete_failed, 
# however not for database errors.
$delete_failed = 0;
```

The script is looking for `report-parser.conf` in the current working directory. If not found it will look by the calling path. If neither is found than it will abort.

Note: Be sure to use the proper hierarchy separator for your server in all folder specs, and if your IMAP server flattens the hierarchy (i.e. Cyrus IMAP with "altnamespace: yes") then leave "Inbox" off of the beginning of such specs.

# Usage

```
./report-parser.pl [OPTIONS] [PATH]
```

PATH can be the filename of a single file or a list of files - wildcard expression are allowed.

**Remember**: This script needs a configurations file called <report-parser.conf> in the current working directory, which defines a database server with credentials and (if used) an IMAP server with credentials.

One of the following source options must be provided:

```
        -i : Read reports from messages on IMAP server as defined in the 
             config file. 
        -m : Read reports from mbox file(s) provided in PATH. 
        -e : Read reports from MIME email file(s) provided in PATH. 
        -x : Read reports from xml file(s) provided in PATH. 
        -j : Read reports from json files(s) provided in PATH. 
        -z : Read reports from zip file(s) provided in PATH. 
```

The following options are always allowed:

```
        -d : Print debug info. 
        -r : Replace existing reports rather than skipping them. 
  --delete : Delete processed message files (the XML is stored in the 
             database for later reference). 
    --info : Print out number of XML files or emails processed. 
     --tls : Force TLS-Only Mode. 
```

Currently, processing of both DMARC and TLS reports during the same run is only supported from IMAP. All other sources will *always* default to DMARC reports unless the `--tls` flag is provided at runtime.
